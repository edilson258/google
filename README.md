# Google back to TF-IDF (Google in Go Lol ðŸ˜‚)

This project is a local search engine developed in Go that utilizes the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm to rank documents based on relevance. It allows users to search for keywords within a corpus of documents and retrieves the most relevant ones according to their TF-IDF scores.
